##### Postgres DB with Docker Compose
* Create 'docker-compose.yml' 

```sh
version: '3.7'
services:
  pg:
    image: 'postgres:latest'
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
    ports:
      - '54320:5432'
    volumes:
      - ./postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata

volumes:
  postgres:
```
<br/>

* Run 'docker-compose' 
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```
<br/>

* As Postgres runs in Docker container, we don't have an easy access to PG client. PG client includes executables such as "pg_restore", "pg_dump", "psql". 
* The following is an easy way to install PG client in Mac.

```sh
$ brew install libpq 
$ brew link --force libpq
```
<br/>

* I use "DBeaver.app" as PG client GUI. You need to specify where PG native clients are located.
```sh
$ which psql
/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin
```
<br/>

* Using Mac, Finder shows default home directory. To find absolute path directories, prese 'command + shift + G'. 
* Paste the path in there such as:

```sh
/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin
```

<br/>

* Using Windows to install libpq, refer the following link.
