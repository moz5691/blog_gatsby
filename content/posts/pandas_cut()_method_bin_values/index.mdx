As you have numerical data on very large scales, you could bin the values into groups.
This helps perform descriptive statistics by groups as generaliing of patterns in the given data.

##### First create random age data
```python 
df_ages = pd.DataFrame({'age': np.random.randint(21, 51, 8)})
df_ages

age
0	45
1	47
2	37
3	41
4	29
5	30
6	30
7	49
```
##### Create new columns of "age_bins"
* Create a new column "age_bins" that sets the *x* argument ot the *age* column in *df_ages* and 
sets the *bins* argument to a list of bin edge values.
* The left bin edge will be exclusive and the right bin edge will be inclusive.

```python
df_ages['age_bins'] = pd.cut(x=df_ages['age'], bins=[20, 29, 39, 49])
df_ages['age_by_decade'] = pd.cut(x=df_ages['age'], bins=[20, 29, 39, 49], labels=['20s', '30s', '40s'])

df_ages

age	age_bins	age_by_decade
0	45	(39, 49]	40s
1	47	(39, 49]	40s
2	37	(29, 39]	30s
3	41	(39, 49]	40s
4	29	(20, 29]	20s
5	30	(29, 39]	30s
6	30	(29, 39]	30s
7	49	(39, 49]	40s
```
